  description: If we can count on one thing in life, it’s LOSS. And no matter the
    type, the greatest investment we can make in ourselves is our willingness
    and commitment to attend to our losses.
description: I bring to my work many years of rich personal and professional
  experience. I have a master’s degree in Counseling and Mental Health and I am
  an ACC ICF certified life coach. I received my training through UC Davis’
  Professional Coaching for Life and Work Program. I had a wonderful, 20-year
  career in hospice bereavement care in both counseling, management and
  leadership. Prior to that, I worked for a decade in human resource
  administration in higher education.  I have weathered many and various losses
  in my life. And I celebrate being a survivor of breast cancer!

    If we can count on one thing in life, it’s LOSS. And no matter the type, the
    greatest investment we can make in ourselves is our willingness and
    commitment to attend to our losses.


    If you’re here reading this, I imagine you or someone you care deeply about has experienced a loss. Maybe it’s related to the death of a loved one, a health crisis, your job or career, the loss of your companion animal, a relationship, an empty nest, or a disconnection with yourself, a hole within you, something missing or incomplete in your life, a significant transition of any sort. Whatever it is, your heart is broken.

  about their java’s origin and support the farmers that grew it. We take coffee
  production, roasting and brewing seriously and we’re glad to pass that
  knowledge to anyone.
